# Marquee Grading Notes
_check the PR for code specific comments_

## General Notes
* Y'all did great -- dates are SO hard to deal with in Javascript, especially without a library to help
* I took a couple points off for readability just because the dates code is a little confusing -- I think some of that could be extracted into functions
* Your styling is great -- really clean
* Would be happy to work with you to refactor that date code to make it easier to work with - just let me know!
